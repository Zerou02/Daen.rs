## Purpose

Ever wanted to do fancy animations in a good programming language? Do you always need to resort to Javascript? Or even worse - a game engine like Godot?
Fear no more, fellow low-level-friend and connoisseur of expressive APIs! The future is now. Although this renderer is not written in C (or Assembly for that manner),
it is still _blazingly_ fast. With the use of the pixels-crate, a hardware-accelerated highly optimizied buffer will convey all your artistic intentions to your
display. Images will follow.

## Final goal

Do the bad Apple

## Recommendations

Don't look at the source code. It will cause severe depression. Please
